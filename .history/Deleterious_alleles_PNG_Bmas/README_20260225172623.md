# Bmas GERP pipeline


Alignement and phylogenetic reconstruction

The previous experiment with alignment of the reads on baits allowed us to investigate the intersection of conserved regions (HyPhy) and regions under selections (GERP). Unfortunately, the SIFT annotations that could pinpoint the deleterious mutations were only made possible by the B.mas annotated genome. And blasting the baits on the B.mas genome gave uncertain results.

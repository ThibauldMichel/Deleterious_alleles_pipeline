7 codons show evidence of episodic diversifying selection (positive selection on some branches, not all).

HyPhy automatically deleted 27 internal branches that had zero length (i.e., no substitutions).

The global ω (dN/dS) is low (~0.06–0.07), meaning overall purifying selection dominates, but some sites still evolve adaptively.

MEME successfully found specific codons under positive selection (significant p-values), and shows which codon changes were common at those positions.


# Ititial model (nucleotide GTR)
Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model
>kill-zero-lengths –> Yes
Deleted 27 zero-length internal branches

    MEME begins by estimating the GTR (General Time Reversible) nucleotide model.

    27 internal branches were zero-length, and these were pruned — otherwise, they could mess with likelihood calculations.

# Step 2:  Global dN/dS (ω) estimate
non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* = 0.0721
Global ω is 0.0721, suggesting purifying selection dominates (dN < dS).

But this doesn't mean no positive selection — MEME looks at variation across branches at each site.


# Step 3: Full codon model fit
full-model –> Yes
non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* = 0.0596
This improves the model fit by using codon-level substitution patterns instead of nucleotides.

ω becomes even smaller, showing strong purifying selection overall.

7 codons show evidence of episodic diversifying selection (positive selection on some branches, not all).

HyPhy automatically deleted 27 internal branches that had zero length (i.e., no substitutions).

The global ω (dN/dS) is low (~0.06–0.07), meaning overall purifying selection dominates, but some sites still evolve adaptively.

MEME successfully found specific codons under positive selection (significant p-values), and shows which codon changes were common at those positions.


# Ititial model (nucleotide GTR)
Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model
>kill-zero-lengths –> Yes
Deleted 27 zero-length internal branches

    MEME begins by estimating the GTR (General Time Reversible) nucleotide model.

    27 internal branches were zero-length, and these were pruned — otherwise, they could mess with likelihood calculations.

# Step 2:  Global dN/dS (ω) estimate
non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* = 0.0721
Global ω is 0.0721, suggesting purifying selection dominates (dN < dS).

But this doesn't mean no positive selection — MEME looks at variation across branches at each site.


# Step 3: Full codon model fit
full-model –> Yes
non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* = 0.0596
This improves the model fit by using codon-level substitution patterns instead of nucleotides.
ω becomes even smaller, showing strong purifying selection overall.

# Step 4: Per-site test results (MEME core)
Column |	Meaning
Codon |	The codon site number (e.g., 2, 4, 6)
alpha |	dS (synonymous substitution rate)
beta+ |	dN (non-synonymous rate on selected branches)
p+ |	    Proportion of branches where positive selection occurred
LRT |	    Likelihood Ratio Test statistic
Episodic selection detected? |	Significance test result (p ≤ 0.1 = yes)
branches |    Number of branches inferred to be under selection
Most common codon substitutions |	Frequent amino acid-altering mutations at this site

QUESTIONS:

There are 1296 bases in the alignment which is analyzed here (ACmerged_contig_1011). In half an hour, here is the output of hyphy meme:

Two questions:
#???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
How is it possible there are so many sites under positive selection on a single gene? is it processing individual bases or codon?
#???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

 It’s processing codons, not individual bases.

    MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) detects positive selection at the codon level, not per nucleotide.

    So, when you see "Site 2", "Site 4", "Site 5", etc., those refer to codon positions in the alignment — not base pairs.

3 bases/codon1296 bases​=432 codons

So you're analyzing 432 codons, not 1296 — and the codon numbers reported by MEME (like 2, 4, 5, etc.) are positions from 1 to 432.

You have ~30 codons flagged as under episodic selection, which is ~7% of all sites — still a relatively high proportion, but not unreasonable depending on:

    The evolutionary depth and branch heterogeneity in your tree.

    Whether the gene has a functional role under diversifying pressure.

    The quality of the alignment and tree.

    Lack of multiple testing correction — MEME p-values need adjustment, or you'll get false positives. MEME does not correct by default, so it's very easy to over-interpret raw output.

    Recommendation:

Apply False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction (e.g. Benjamini-Hochberg) to your p-values before trusting the number of selected sites. You’ll likely find the number of confidently selected sites drops substantially.

If you want help applying FDR correction to this MEME table, I can do that for you in Python or R.
